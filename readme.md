## HubTime ##

HubTime is a simple website that uses GitHub credentials, issues, and comments to create a timesheet system.

To use, simply clone this repository into a directory that can serve Python CGI scripts over the web. Then, add the tag `HubTime` to any of your GitHub issues that you'd like HubTime to track.

That's it. More features like data visualization will be coming soon, but in the meantime this should be feature complete.
